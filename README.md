# Description

This Vagrantfile creates a full Chef Automate Environment (Chef Server, Delivery Server and a Build Node).

# Usage
Clone the repository. Generate or use your own certificates (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub), put them into the folder, add a Delivery license and the Delivery binaries as well and start it using "vagrant up".
Keep in mind that IP addresses and binaries are fixed, you have to change them to your version and you preferred IP address.
